## Assignment for NAB

This assignment has not completed yet, a lot of thing still on the tracks:

### Feature
1. Download (zip, image): At least it can download from array image asynchronously. Please uncomment code inside *`viewDidLoad`* of ViewController.swift and check file path of simulator to test.
2. Unzip

### TODO:
1. Work with NSSessionDownloadDelegate to calculate progress for download.
2. Use iOS Background Transfer Service to support downloading.
3. Stop/resume/start download.
4. PDF to image
5. CollectionView
6. Integrate with Interface

Thank you.
